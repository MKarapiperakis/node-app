# Developing RESTful Web Services with Node.js and Express

Welcome! Before you get started, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed and configured.

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js:** This project is developed and tested with Node.js version 10.18.1. It is recommended to use this specific version for compatibility.

    ```bash
    # Install Node.js 10.18.1 using your preferred version manager (e.g., nvm or n)
    nvm install 10.18.1
    ```

2. **Server:** Ensure that a server is set up and running. This app relies on a server to function correctly.

3. **Environment Variables:**
